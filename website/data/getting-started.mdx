# Getting Started

UI Machines can be used within most JSX frameworks like Vue, React and Solid.

To get UI machines running, you'll need to:

- Install the specific machine(s). e.g accordion, pin-input
- install your framework binding. e.g. react, vue, svelte
- Connect the machine to the framework binding by using the `useMachine` hook

## Install the machine

There are 16 machine packages available for you. Install whichever you need for your project. For example, to install
the `Accordion` machine, run: `npm install @ui/machines/accordion`

## Install the framework package

UI machine is framework agnostic and supports React, Vue and Solid. Follow the steps below to use in your preferred
framework.

### **Usage with React**

Using the machines within React is fairly straight forward. You'll need to:

- Install `@ui-machines/react`
- Import `useMachine` from the package

The machines were developed with React-first mindset. Well, mostly because the creator (Segun Adebayo) is more of React
freak, Lol.

Here's a sample code that consumes a toggle machine in React.

```jsx
import { useMemo } from "react"
import { useMachine } from "@ui-machines/react"
import * as Toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"

export default function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine)
  const { buttonProps, isActive } = useMemo(() => Toggle.connect(state, send), [state])
  return <button {...buttonProps}>{isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
}
```

> UI machines uses `valtio` behind the scenes to provide automatic render optimizations due to the `useSnapshot` hook
> used within the machine hook. [Learn more](https://github.com/pmndrs/valtio#react-via-usesnapshot)

### **Usage with Vue 3 (JSX)**

While you can use the UI machines in Vue without JSX, we recommend using JSX as a means to consume output of the
`connect` function. Here's what you need to do:

- Install `@ui-machines/vue` which provides the reactivity hook needed for vue.
- Import `useMachine` from the package
- Import and use `normalizeProps` to convert the JSX attributes to a format compatible with Vue.
- For TypeScript users, you can import and use `VuePropTypes` to get better TS experience for JSX attributes.

```jsx
import { computed, defineComponent } from "vue"
import * as Toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"
import { useMachine, normalizeProps } from "@ui-machines/vue"

export default defineComponent({
  name: "Toggle",
  setup() {
    const [state, send] = useMachine(Toggle.machine)
    const connect = computed(() => Toggle.connect(state, send, normalizeProps))
    return () => {
      const { buttonProps, isActive } = connect.value
      return <button {...buttonProps}>{isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
    }
  },
})
```

### **Usage with Solid.js**

We love Solid.js and we've added support for it. Here's what you need to do:

- Install `@ui-machines/solid`
- Import `useMachine` from the package
- Import and use `normalizeProps` to convert JSX attributes to a format compatible with Solid.js
- For TypeScript users, you can import and use `SolidPropTypes` to get better TS experience for JSX attributes.

```jsx
import { createMemo } from "solid-js"
import * as Toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"
import { useMachine, normalizeProps } from "@ui-machines/solid"

export default function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(Toggle.machine)
  const { buttonProps, isActive } = createMemo(() => Toggle.connect(state, send))
  return <button {...buttonProps}>{isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
}
```

#### Why the need for `normalizeProps`?

Most JSX framework use a different naming convention for their JSX attributes. For example, in React, the keydown
listener property is`onKeyDown` while in vue the correct property is `onKeydown`. These little nuances between
frameworks is handled for you automatically.

The goal of UI machines is to help you abstract the interaction and accessible patterns into a statechart so you never
have to write them over and again.

Thanks for reading! Let's get started with the components and machines.
