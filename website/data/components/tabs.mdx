# Tabs

An accessible tabs component that provides keyboard interactions and ARIA attributes described in the WAI-ARIA Tabs
Design Pattern.

## Features

- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions on tabs
- Support for LTR and RTL keyboard navigation
- Support for disabled tabs
- Follows the tabs ARIA pattern, semantically linking tabs and their associated tab panels

## Installation

To use the editable machine in your project, install the respective package

<InstallSnippet package="@ui-machines/tabs" />

```jsx
import * as Tabs from "@ui-machines/tabs"
```

Next, you'll need to install the binding for your framework

<CodeSnippet id="tabs/installation.mdx" />

## Basic usage

Tabs consist of a tab list with one or more visually separated tabs. Each tab has associated content, and only the
selected tab's content is shown.

Tabs are built using the `tablistProps`, `getTabProps`, `getTabPanelProps` property and getter.

<CodeSnippet id="tabs/basic-usage.mdx" />

## Showing an indicator

To show an active indicator when a tab is selected, you add the `tabIndicatorProps` object provided by the `connect`
function.

<CodeSnippet id="tabs/with-indicator.mdx" />

## Styling the selected tab

When a tab button is selected, a `data-selected` attribute is added to it. You can use this to style the selected state.

```css
[data-part="tab"][data-selected] {
  /* Styles for selected tab */
}
```

## Disabling a tab

When a Tab is `disabled`, it is skipped during keyboard navigation and it is not clickable. To disable a tab, set the
`disabled` property in the `getTabProps` to `true`.

<CodeSnippet id="tabs/disabling-tab.mdx" />

## Events

When the selected tab is changed, an `onChange` callback gets invoked with the `value` of the selected tab.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Tabs.machine.withContext({
    onChange(value) {
      console.log("selected tab:", value)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Setting the initial selected tab

To set the tab to be selected initially, pass the `value` prop to the machine's context.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Tabs.machine.withContext({
    value: "tab-one",
  }),
)
```

## Manual tab activation

By default, `Tabs` are activated automatically. This means when you use the arrow keys to change tabs, the tab is
activated and focused.

In this scenario, you should use a manually activated tab, it moves focus without activating the tabs. With focus on a
specific tab, users can activate a tab by pressing Space or Enter.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Tabs.machine.withContext({
    activationMode: "manual",
  }),
)
```

## Selecting a Tab Programmatically

To set the value of the selected tab programmatically, you can use the `setValue` function provided by the connect
function.

<CodeSnippet id="tabs/programmatic-control.mdx" />

## Vertical tab

To use vertical tabs, pass the `orientation` property to the context and set it to `vertical`. This will ensure the up
and down keys are used for keyboard interactions.

> Ensure you style your tabs to appear vertically

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Tabs.machine.withContext({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```
