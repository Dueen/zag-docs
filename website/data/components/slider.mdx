# Slider

The Slider is used to allow users to make selections from a range of values. Think of it as a custom
`<input type='range'/>` with the ability to achieve custom styling and accessibility.

## Features

- Supports centered origin (slider starting at center, instead of start position)
- Fully managed keyboard navigation
- Supports touch or click on track to update value
- Supports Right-to-Left directionality
- Support for horizontal and vertical orientations
- Prevents text selection while dragging

## Installation

To use the editable machine in your project, install the respective package

<InstallSnippet package="@ui-machines/slider" />

```jsx
import * as Slider from "@ui-machines/slider"
```

Then you'll need to install the binding for your framework of choice

<CodeSnippet id="slider/installation.mdx" />

## Usage

The slider's connect function exposes the `labelProps`, `outputProps`, `thumbProps`, `rangeProps` and `rootProps` you
can compose the slider UI.

<CodeSnippet id="slider/basic-usage.mdx" />

## Changing the orientation of the slider

By default, the slider is assumed to be horizontal. To change the orientation to vertical, set the `orientation`
property in the machine's context to `vertical`.

In this mode, the slider will use the arrow up and down keys to increment/decrement its value.

> Don't forget to change the styles of the vertical slider by specifying its height

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Slider.machine.withContext({
    orientation: "vertical",
  }),
)
```

<CodeSnippet id="slider/vertical-slider.mdx" />

## Specifying the minimum and maximum

By default, the minimum is `0` and the maximum is `100`. If that's not what you want, you can easily specify different
bounds by changing the values of the min and/or max attributes.

For example, to ask the user for a value between `-10` and `10`, you can use:

<CodeSnippet id="slider/setting-min-max.mdx" />

## Setting the value's granularity

By default, the granularity, is `1`, meaning that the value is always an integer. You can change the step attribute to
control the granularity.

For example, If you need a value between `5` and `10`, accurate to two decimal places, you should set the value of step
to `0.01`:

<CodeSnippet id="slider/setting-step.mdx" />

## Listening for changes

When the slider value changes, the `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` callbacks are invoked. You can use this to setup custom
behaviors in your app.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Slider.machine.withContext({
    onChange(value) {
      console.log("value is changing to:", value)
    },
    onChangeEnd(value) {
      console.log("value has changed to:", value)
    },
  }),
)
```

## Getting and setting the slider values

The slider's connect function provides properties and methods you can use to programmatically read and set the slider's
value.

- **Properties:** `isFocused`, `isDragging`, `value`, `percent`
- **Methods:** `setValue`, `getPercentValue`, `blur`, `focus`, `increment` and `decrement`

<CodeSnippet id="slider/programmatic-control.mdx" />

## Changing the start position of the slider

By default, the slider's "zero position" is usually at the start position (left in LTR and right in RTL). In scenarios
where the value represents an offset (or relative value), it might be useful to change the "zero position" to center.

To do this, pass the `origin` context property to `center`.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  Slider.machine.withContext({
    origin: "center",
  }),
)
```

<CodeSnippet id="slider/center-origin.mdx" />

## Usage within forms

To use slider within forms, use the exposed `inputProps` from the `connect` function and ensure you pass `name` value to
the machine's context. It will render a hidden input and ensure the value changes get propagated to the form correctly.

<CodeSnippet id="slider/form-usage.mdx" />

## Using slider marks

In some cases you might need to define a series of mark along the slider track. To achieve this, use the exposed
`getMarkerProps` from the `connect` function and position the slider marks relative to the track.

<CodeSnippet id="slider/using-marks.mdx" />

## Styling guide

**Slider Thumb**

```css
[data-part="thumb"] {
  /* base styles for the thumb */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for the focused state */
}

[data-part="thumb"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for horizontal or vertical  */
}
```

**Slider Track**

```css
[data-part="track"] {
  /* base styles for the track */
}

[data-part="track"][data-disabled] {
  /* styles for disabled state */
}

[data-part="track"][data-focus] {
  /* styles for when the slider is focused */
}

[data-part="track"][data-orientation="(horizontal|vertical)"] {
  /* styles for slider orientation */
}
```

**Slider Marker**

```css
[data-part="marker"] {
  /* base styles for marker */
}

[data-part="marker"][data-state="(at|under|over)-value"] {
  /* styles for when the value exceeds the marker's value */
}
```
