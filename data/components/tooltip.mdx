# Tooltip

A tooltip is a brief, informative message that appears when a user interacts
with an element. Tooltips are usually initiated when a button is focused or
hovered.

<Showcase id="Tooltip" />

**Features**

- Show tooltip on hover and focus.
- Hide tooltip on esc or pointer down.
- Only one tooltip shows at a time.
- Labeling support for screen readers via `aria-describedby`.
- Custom show and hide delay support.
- Matches native tooltip behavior with delay on hover of first tooltip and no
  delay on subsequent tooltips.

## Installation

To use the tooltip machine in your project, run the following command in your
command line:

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/installation.mdx" />

This command will install the framework agnostic tooltip logic and the reactive
utilities for your framework of choice.

Now you can use the tooltip in your project!

```jsx
import * as tooltip from "@ui-machines/tooltip"
```

## Anatomy

To set up the tooltip correctly, you'll need to understand its anatomy and how
we name its parts.

> Each part includes a `data-part` attribute to help identify them in the DOM.

On a high level, the tooltip consists of:

- **Trigger**: The trigger for the tooltip.
- **Positioner**: The element that dynamically positions the tooltip.
- **Arrow**: The arrow that points to the trigger.
- **Content**: The element that houses the content of the tooltip.

## Usage

To get the tooltip working correct, you'll need to:

- Setup the tooltip portal, this is a shared container for all tooltips
- Add the `triggerProps`, and `tooltipProps` to the elements

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/usage.mdx" />

## Customizing the timings

By default, the tooltip is designed to open after `1000ms` and close after
`500ms`. You can customize this by passing the `openDelay` and `closeDelay`
context properties.

```jsx {3-4}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine.withContext({
    openDelay: 500,
    closeDelay: 200,
  }),
)
```

## Adding an arrow

To render an arrow within the tooltip, use the `api.arrowProps` and
`api.innerArrowProps`.

```jsx {6-8}
//...
const api = popover.connect(state, send)
//...
return (
  <div {...api.positionerProps}>
    <div {...api.arrowProps}>
      <div {...api.innerArrowProps} />
    </div>
    <div {...api.contentProps}>{/* ... */}</div>
  </div>
)
//...
```

## Pointerdown behavior

By default, the tooltip will close when the pointer is down on its trigger. To
prevent this behavior, pass the `closeOnPointerDown` context property and set it
to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine.withContext({
    closeOnPointerDown: false,
  }),
)
```

## Closing on Esc

The tooltip is designed to close when the escape key is pressed. To prevent
this, pass the `closeOnEscape` context property and set it to `false`.

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine.withContext({
    closeOnEsc: false,
  }),
)
```

## Making the tooltip interactive

Tooltips are interactive by default. That means it'll remain open even the
pointer leaves the trigger and move into the tooltip's content.

To disabled this behavior, pass the `interactive` context property and set it to
`false`.

> Disabling this will violate the
> [WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.13](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus)

```jsx {3}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine.withContext({
    interactive: false,
  }),
)
```

## Using custom labels

By default, the only content announced to them is whatever is in the tooltip. On
some cases you may want the screen readers to know more information about the
trigger (e.g. a notifications system with count).

For this use-case, pass the `aria-label` context property and use the
`labelProps` exposed in the tooltip's connect function.

<CodeSnippet id="tooltip/custom-label.mdx" />

## Events

When the tooltip open or closes, the `onOpen` and `onClose` callbacks are fired.

```jsx {3-8}
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  tooltip.machine.withContext({
    onOpen() {
      console.log("Tooltip opened")
    },
    onClose() {
      console.log("Tooltip closed")
    },
  }),
)
```

## Methods and Properties

The accordion's connect method exposes the following methods:

- `isOpen` — Whether the tooltip is open or not.
- `open()` — Function used to programmatically open the tooltip.
- `close()` — Function used to programmatically close the tooltip.

```jsx
api.isOpen // => boolean

api.open()

api.close()
```

## Styling guide

Earlier, we mentioned that each tooltip part has a `data-part` attribute added
to them to select and style them in the DOM.

### Open and close states

When the tooltip is open, the `data-expanded` attribute is added to the trigger

```css
[data-part="trigger"][data-expanded] {
  /* styles for the trigger's expanded state */
}
```

### Styling the tooltip

```css
[data-part="content"] {
  /* styles for the content */
}
```

### Using arrows

When using arrows within the menu, you can style it using css variables.

```css
[data-part="arrow"] {
  --arrow-size: 20px;
  --arrow-background: red;
}
```
