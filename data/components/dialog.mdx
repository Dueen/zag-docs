# Dialog

A dialog is a window overlaid on either the primary window or another dialog window. Content behind a modal dialog is
inert, meaning that users cannot interact with it.

## Features

- Supports modal and non-modal modes.
- Focus is automatically trapped and scrolling is blocked when modal.
- Manages screen reader announcements with Title and Description components.
- `Esc` closes the dialog automatically.

## Installation

To use the accordion machine in your project, install the respective package

<InstallSnippet package="@ui-machines/dialog" />

```jsx
import * as Dialog from "@ui-machines/dialog"
```

Next, you'll also need to install the framework binding

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/installation.mdx" />

## Usage

The dialog machine exposes the `triggerProps`, `overlayProps`, `contentProps`, `titleProps`, `descriptionProps`, and
`closeButtonProps` following properties to get it working correctly:

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/usage.mdx" />

## Opening and Closing the dialog

By default, the dialog opens when the trigger is clicked. If you need programmatically open the dialog from other
elements, you can leverage the exposed `open` and `close` methods.

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/open-close.mdx" />

## Managing focus within the dialog

When the dialog opens, it automatically sets focus on the first focusable elements and traps focus within it, so that
tabbing will be contrained within it. To control the element that should receive focus on open, pass the
`initialFocusEl` context (which can be an element or a function that returns an element)

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/initial-focus.mdx" />

When it closes, it restores focus back to the trigger. To control the element that should receive focus on close, pass
the `finalFocusEl` context (which can be an element or a function that returns an element)

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/final-focus.mdx" />

## Closing the dialog on overlay click

By default, the dialog closes when you click its overlay. You can set `closeOnOverlayClick` to false if you want the
modal to stay visible.

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/close-on-overlay-click.mdx" />

## Controlling the scroll behavior

When the dialog is open, it prevents scrolling on the `body` element. To disable this behavior, set the `preventScroll`
context to `false`.

<CodeSnippet id="dialog/prevent-scroll.mdx" />
