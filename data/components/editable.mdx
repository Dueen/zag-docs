# Editable

Editable Text is used for inline renaming of some text. It appears as normal UI text but transforms into a text input
field when the user clicks on or focuses it.

## Features

- Use custom controls for the editable.
- `Enter` commits the input value.
- `Esc` reverts the value.
- Edit value on double click or focus

## Installation

To use the editable machine in your project, install the respective package

<InstallSnippet package="@ui-machines/editable" />

```jsx
import * as Editable from "@ui-machines/editable"
```

Then you'll need to install the binding for your framework of choice

<CodeSnippet id="editable/installation.mdx" />

## Usage

The editable machine exposes the `triggerProps`, `overlayProps`, `contentProps`, `titleProps`, `descriptionProps`, and
`closeButtonProps` following properties to get it working correctly:

<CodeSnippet id="editable/usage.mdx" />

# Using custom controls

In some cases, you might need to use custom controls to toggle the edit and read mode. We use the render prop pattern to
provide access to the internal state of the component.

<CodeSnippet id="editable/custom-controls.mdx" />
