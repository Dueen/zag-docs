# TypeScript Usage

Working with TypeScript can help you detect many errors via static analysis done
by the TypeScript compiler. TypeScript also improves the developer experience by
providing:

- Useful auto-completion in your IDEs.
- Ensuring the JSX attributes used are strongly typed.

## Usage Notes

### `useSetup`

The setup hook is used to ensure that the component works in any `window`
environment (iframes, electron, etc.).

The hook returns a `ref` function or object that you need to attach to an
element in order for the machines to retrieve the correct reference to `window`
and `document`.

To make it work in TypeScript, you'll need to add an extra generic for the
element type you want to attach the `ref` to.

```tsx
const ref = useSetup<HTMLButtonElement>({ send, id: "1" })
```

### `connect`

To ensure that the properties you spread unto the JSX elements is strongly typed
in your framework, you'll need to:

- Import the `PropTypes` type and add it as a generic argument.
- Import the `normalizeProps` function to help convert JSX properties to
  Vue-compatible equivalent.

> **Note**: This step isn't required for React

**In Vue.js**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"
import { PropTypes, normalizeProps } from "@zag-js/vue"

const Accordion = defineComponent({
  // ...
  setup() {
    // ...
    const apiRef = computed(() =>
      accordion.connect<PropTypes>(state, send, normalizeProps),
    )
    // ...
  },
})
```

**In Solid.js**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"
import { PropTypes, normalizeProps } from "@zag-js/solid"

const Accordion = (props) => {
  // ...
  const api = createMemo(() =>
    accordion.connect<PropTypes>(state, send, normalizeProps),
  )
  // ...
}
```
