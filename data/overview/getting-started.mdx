# Getting Started

UI Machines can be used within most JSX frameworks like Vue, React and Solid.

To get UI machines running, you'll need to:

- Install the specific machine(s). e.g accordion, pin-input
- Install your framework binding. e.g. react, vue, svelte
- Connect the machine to the framework binding by using the `useMachine` hook

## Install the machine

Install the machine for the component you need in your project. For example, to
use the accordion machine, you'll need to install `@ui-machines/accordion`

## Install the framework package

UI machine is framework agnostic and supports React, Vue and Solid. Follow the
steps below to use in your preferred framework.

### Usage with React

Using the machines within React is fairly straight forward. You'll need to:

- Install `@ui-machines/react`
- Import `useMachine` from the package

The machines were developed with React-first mindset. Well, mostly because the
creator (Segun Adebayo) is more of React freak, Lol.

Here's a sample code that consumes a toggle machine in React.

```jsx
import { useMachine } from "@ui-machines/react"
import * as toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"

export default function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggle.machine)
  const api = toggle.connect(state, send)
  return <button {...api.buttonProps}>{api.isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
}
```

> UI machines uses `valtio` behind the scenes to provide automatic render
> optimizations due to the `useSnapshot` hook used within the machine hook.

### Usage with Vue 3 (JSX)

While you can use the UI machines in Vue without JSX, we recommend using JSX as
a means to consume output of the `connect` function. Here's what you need to do:

- Install `@ui-machines/vue` which provides the reactivity hook needed for vue.
- Import `useMachine` from the package
- Import and use `normalizeProps` to convert the JSX attributes to a format
  compatible with Vue.
- For TypeScript users, you can import and use `VuePropTypes` to get better TS
  experience for JSX attributes.

```jsx
import { computed, defineComponent, h, Fragment } from "vue"
import * as toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"
import { useMachine, normalizeProps } from "@ui-machines/vue"

export default defineComponent({
  name: "Toggle",
  setup() {
    const [state, send] = useMachine(toggle.machine)
    const apiRef = computed(() => toggle.connect(state, send, normalizeProps))
    return () => {
      const api = apiRef.value
      return <button {...api.buttonProps}>{api.isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
    }
  },
})
```

### Usage with Solid.js

We love Solid.js and we've added support for it. Here's what you need to do:

- Install `@ui-machines/solid`
- Import `useMachine` from the package
- Import and use `normalizeProps` to convert JSX attributes to a format
  compatible with Solid.js
- For TypeScript users, you can import and use `SolidPropTypes` to get better TS
  experience for JSX attributes.

```jsx
import { createMemo } from "solid-js"
import * as toggle from "@ui-machines/toggle"
import { useMachine, normalizeProps } from "@ui-machines/solid"

export default function Toggle() {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggle.machine)
  const api = createMemo(() => toggle.connect(state, send))
  return <button {...api().buttonProps}>{api.isActive ? "On" : "Off"}</button>
}
```

#### Why the need for `normalizeProps`?

Most JSX framework use a different naming convention for their JSX attributes.
For example, in React, the keydown listener property is `onKeyDown` while in vue
the correct property is `onKeydown`. These little nuances between frameworks are
handled automatically when you use `normalizeProps`.

> accessibility patterns into a statechart so you never have to re-invent the
> wheel.
