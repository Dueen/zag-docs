# Programmatic Control

In the react world we call this "controlled" and "uncontrolled" components or state. To achieve this, the machine
provide three ways to define its initial context.

### Using exposed methods

The `connect` method of any component machine provide helpful methods to change the machine state or update its context.
This approach is recommended approach.

Let's say we'd like to change the expanded accordion item in an accordion group. Here's how to do that:

```jsx
// 1. Bind the machine in your framework
const [state, send] = useMachine(Accordion.machine)

// 2. Call the connect function
const accordion = Accordion.connect(state, send)

// 3. Use exposed methods
accordion.setValue("item-1")
```

### Setting initial context

`<machine>.withContext(...)`: This is used to set the **initial** context value of the machine. It can't be updated
later on.

For example, let's stay we want an accordion to start with a specific selected value but allow the user change it later
on. Here's how to acheive that.

```jsx
const [state, send] = useMachine(
  // set initial context value
  Accordion.machine.withContext({
    value: "item-1",
  }),
)
```

### Setting and controlling context programmatically

In some cases you might want to control the component's context via props or in response to some external event. To
achieve this, pass the `context` in the `useMachine`'s second argument.

```jsx
// external value (e.g. from props)
const value = "item-1"

// control context with external value
const [state, send] = useMachine(Accordion.machine, {
  context: { value },
})
```
